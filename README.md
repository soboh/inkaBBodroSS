inkaBB odroSS
============

inkaBB odroSS is a windows application aims to help students locking their computers for studies purposes.
The application shows the students all the opened windows and let him choose some of them to be the only windows that are allowed to be opened in a period of time that he set. 
Thus, for example, if you want to study for Algorithms course, you need to open the related windows and then choose them with this application and it will prevent you from running other windows in a period of time that you set.

I tried the application on Windows 7 and it is working fine.
The project was developed on Visual Studio Professional 2012.
